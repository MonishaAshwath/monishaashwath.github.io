About
======
Warm Greetings! I am Monisha A, currently working as a Software Engineer at the [ZevA(Dori Health Pvt Ltd)](https://www.zevahealth.com/). I pursued my undergraduate in Computer Science and Engineering from RajaRajeswari College of Engineering. My primary research interests are in Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing & Domain Adaptation and actively read about the latest advancements in other domains in AI. In my free time, I blog about algorithms that are related to my research interests.


Update
------
Iâ€™ll be soon writing blog posts and start adding projects related to Computer Vision / NLP / RL and other Deep Learning topics on this site with the goal of contributing to open-source and keeping myself updated on the latest AI research. Visit again soon!
